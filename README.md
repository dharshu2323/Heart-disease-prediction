Developed a predictive model for heart disease diagnosis using machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and provide accurate risk assessments. This project involved building and deploying a web application to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilized a comprehensive dataset containing various health parameters and diagnostic features to train and evaluate the model.
Model Development: Implemented linear regression and other machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.
Data Processing: Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Web Application: Developed a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, enabling users to input patient data and receive predictions and risk assessments in real-time.
Technologies: Python, Streamlit, Linear Regression, Scikit-learn
